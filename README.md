# AltStatus

## What is AltStatus?

When you are learning something, it's beneficial to track your learning process. At AltCampus students are required to do a bunch of things to keep track of their progress. They have to tweet daily about what did they learn that day and write a blog post once a week. Beside tweets and blog, students will also write a reflection of that particular day.  Altstatus helps them to organize and track their progress.


A Student can submit their tweet URL, blog-post URL(if it's Saturday) and reflection of the day. By this way, they can track of their progress. They will get a notification at a specific time of the day, asking them about whether they had submited the links or not.


## Student flow

There will be two screens in the app.
- Screen-1 (Login/Signup page)
- Screen-2 (Student Dashboard)

### Screen-1

If student has already signup then he will see login page otherwise student have to signup on the app.


### Screen-2
After signing in to the app, the student will see the dashboard. Now the dashboard screen will be divided into two parts. First part will be the *submission form* and second part will be the *list of previous submissions*.

Now here is a condition on the first part, if student have already submited the form then he will see his today's submission, otherwise he will see the submission form.

**Submission Form** will be different on Saturday. Because on Saturday, the students will have to submit their blog-post link. On other days they have to submit just their tweet URL and reflection of the day.
